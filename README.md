# GirlsCreateIT
**scaffolded examples to teach computational thinking concepts**

This is a Rails 3 application I made in 2012 to facilitate Dr. Heidi Webb's project, GirlsCreateIT, which was equal parts dissertation research and outreach effort.

Heidi and I led multiple after-school programs for young girls, aged 6thâ€“8th grade, to introduce computational thinking concepts across 2012 and 2013.  We had a session using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), one with [Alice](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/learn/alice/), one with [Lego Mindstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms), etc.

## This repository
This repository contains the application I wrote for one such session on databases and websites.  The students followed a workbook I'd written to query a relational database and design webpages using the results of their queries, themed around the idea of running a Zoo.  It was great work and the ability to interact directly with students and design curricula for them inspired me to pursue my Master's degree.

## Research Results
Dr. Webb published on GirlsCreateIT in *Using scaffolded examples to teach computational thinking concepts*.  The full text is available through ACM: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2445196.2445227
